# pdb


This repository contains a script which utilised pdb to provide useful functions.

The goal is to provide the following:

 - List servers (including mgmt ip) matching hostname/regex
 - SSH to server matching hostname/regex
 - Allow querying of arbitrary facts
 - Automated SSH to multiple servers (threaded/single)
